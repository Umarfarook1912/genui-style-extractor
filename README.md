**Demo (interactive):** https://app.supademo.com/demo/cmjy8gbv100fixz0i6ajh2cbb?utm_source=link

Materials included: GenUI – Description Document (PDF) and project PPT.

Short description
-----------------
GenUI extracts visual styles from webpages,images and Figma, then converts them to production-ready CSS, Tailwind classes, or JSX styles for React.

Quick run (build & package)
---------------------------
From repository root:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
# then copy build to catalyst client as described in docs/SETUP_AND_DEPLOY.md
```

Hackathon submission notes
-------------------------
- This `README.md` is intentionally concise for reviewers.
- See `docs/SETUP_AND_DEPLOY.md` for full build/deploy steps and `sigma-package/` for packaging.
- Keep per-package lockfiles (e.g., `frontend/package-lock.json`); the root `package-lock.json` is unused and removed from the repo.
